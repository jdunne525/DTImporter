HID Descriptor tool import tool
The version 2.4 HID descriptor tool from usb.org tragically doesn't contain an import .c file functionality.
It only supports its own proprietary .hid file format (which fortunately is fairly simple).
This tool is written in VB6.

This tool imports a .c file containing only the report descriptor and outputs a .hid file containing the descriptors
imported.  Note that DT.exe will choke when trying to parse the descriptor unless actually COPY the .HID file to the
folder where the dt.exe tool is located.

Limitations of the tool:  (I threw this together in 2 hours, so don't expect perfection)

//The tool properly ignores // comment lines and BLANK lines, but does not support C style comments /* */
//Remove C style comments if they are used in your application.
//The tool looks for a comma to determine if the line contains data.  (It isn't exactly all that intelligent of a parser)
//You'll have to add a comma to the LAST line of your descriptor definition for the tool to find it properly.
//The tool only supports ONE ITEM PER LINE!!  
//So, if you've got 0xC0, 0xC0 on a single line to end 2 collections, the tool will FAIL to import that data.
